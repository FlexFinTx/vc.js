# @transmute/linked-data-proof

This typescript module has been built to support direct substitutability with [digitalbazaar/jsonld-signatures](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/jsonld-signatures) for Linked Data Proofs.

Some changes were made to support typescript and there is no `defaultDocumentLoader`.
